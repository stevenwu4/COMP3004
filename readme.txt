TAEval Instructor APIWhat is it?-------------The TAEval Instructor API system is the application programming interface for TAEval, a proposed client-server application to be used by TAs, Instructors, and Administrators that will allow Instructors to assign tasks to TAs of the course they are instructing and to provide feedback to the TAs about how they are doing on their tasks.The Latest Version------------------------This is the first release of the API and its GUI for testcases, v 1.0.Documentation--------------------Commonly used classes include the model classes Course, Task, and TeachingAssistant, as well as our NetworkConnection proxy to QTcpSocket.Data transfer occurs from Client to Server by both respectively listening for eachotherÕs signal processPacket(), which attaches a packetId along with the packetData in the call to give enough information for the observing side.Client Side:When Main runs, an instance of TAEval, our faade for the commonly used classes used to talk to the server, is created. The main window is displayed and ensures that TAEval will be deleted after the application shuts down.The Controller classes correspond to each of the six test cases that takes input from the user on what button was selected to calling the correct corresponding test cases.The TAEval faade provides a high level interface for all requests to the server.Server Side:When Main runs, an instance of the Server is created. Ensures that the app will shutdown properly if serverÕs signals are finished and that the server will be deleted after the application is about to quit. The Server handles incoming connections by threading client connections.A ClientConnection is responsible for initializing and communicating with the database. It handles all requests from the Client based on packetId and calls the corresponding API call. DBManager is a proxy to the SQLite database from QT. It handles all of the initializations, tables, queries and requests sent to the Server.Installation---------------The program must be run on the platform provided by the official COMP3004 32-bit VM. The VM will provide the necessary release of QT Creator required to build and run the program.  Ensure that in each folder, TAEvalClient and TAEvalServer, that there is a respective .pro file that manages the make configurations.To set up the program, first open up QT Creator. At the introductory Welcome tab, click Open New Project. Pick either of the two folders, then under the Projects tab, right-click and click Load Project to load the remaining folder.Build & Usage-------Once the two projects are loaded properly, right click both folders and select Build. 

Once both are done building, it is imperative to Run TAEvalServer before TAEvalClient, or else the program will hang.

Read the text description to see what part of the API you are testing, and click the button to run the test case. The box to the right will light up green if success, red if failure. 

To avoid problems at this stage, ensure that in Tools -> Options, under Environment in the General tab, that Terminal path is set to
